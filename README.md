A professional web application that uses your device's camera to measure real-world objects with high accuracy through calibration and computer vision techniques.

## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **Camera Access**: Real-time camera feed with high-resolution support
- **Smart Calibration**: Use common objects (credit cards, A4 paper, US dollar) or custom dimensions
- **Precise Measurements**: Click two points to measure distances with pixel-perfect accuracy
- **Multiple Units**: Support for centimeters, millimeters, and inches with automatic conversion
- **Visual Overlays**: Clear measurement lines and labels displayed directly on the video feed

### Advanced Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Customizable UI**: Adjustable line colors, widths, and display preferences
- **Measurement History**: Track all measurements with timestamps
- **Professional Interface**: Modern, intuitive design with smooth animations
- **Cross-Platform**: Works in all modern browsers with WebRTC support
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable, offline-capable, and native app-like experience

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Camera Access
The app uses the WebRTC `getUserMedia` API to access your device's camera, providing a live video feed for measurement.

### 2. Calibration Process
- **Reference Object**: Place a known object (like a credit card) in the camera view
- **Point Selection**: Click two points on the reference object to establish scale
- **Scale Calculation**: The app calculates the pixel-to-real-world conversion ratio
- **Accuracy**: This calibration ensures measurements are accurate to within millimeters

### 3. Measurement Process
- **Point Selection**: Click two points on the object you want to measure
- **Real-Time Calculation**: The app instantly calculates the real-world distance
- **Visual Feedback**: Measurement lines and values are overlaid on the video
- **Unit Conversion**: Automatic conversion between different measurement units

### 4. Mathematical Foundation
```
Real Length = (Pixel Distance / Reference Pixel Length) √ó Reference Real Length
Scale Factor = Reference Real Length / Reference Pixel Length
```

## üì± Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: 53+ (Recommended)
- **Firefox**: 36+
- **Safari**: 11+
- **Edge**: 79+
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 11+, Chrome Mobile 53+

## üìê Accuracy Considerations

### Best Practices for High Accuracy
1. **Camera Position**: Keep the camera perpendicular to the measured surface
2. **Lighting**: Ensure good, even lighting for clear object edges
3. **Reference Object**: Use flat, rigid objects with known dimensions
4. **Distance**: Maintain consistent distance between camera and objects
5. **Calibration**: Recalibrate if camera position or lighting changes

### Limitations
- **2D Measurements**: Best suited for flat surfaces and objects
